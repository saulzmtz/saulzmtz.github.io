I love data â€” exploring it, wrangling it, and uncovering the stories hidden inside. I recently earned my M.S. in Advanced Data Analytics, where I gained hands-on experience in statistical analysis with Python and Excel, building interactive data visualizations in Tableau and Plotly, and creating and evaluating machine learning models in Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab.

I majored in Philosophy and have taught English Language Arts to students from 5th to 10th grade. I have also led data-driven initiatives, designed intervention strategies, and analyzed performance metrics as a grade team leader, teacher manager, instructional coach, Critical Student Intervention Coordinator, ELL Coordinator, Individualized Learning Specialist, Principal-in-Residence and Dean of Instruction. My extensive background (20+ years) in K-12 education (M.Ed. in Curriculum and Instruction) helps me bring a unique perspective to data exploration and analysis.
