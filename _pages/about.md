I enjoy exploring, wrangling, and analyzing data to derive meaningful insights and solutions (M.S. in Advanced Data Analytics). My coursework and project experience includes statistical analysis using Excel and Python, interactive data visualizations with Plotly and Tableau, and building machine learning models in Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab environments.

Along with data, I love languages, cultures and literature. I majored in Philosophy and have been the creative director of too many English Language Arts classrooms! My extensive background (20+ years) in K-12 education (M.Ed. in Curriculum and Instruction) helps me bring a unique perspective to data exploration and analysis. Apart from the classroom, I have also led data-driven initiatives, designed intervention strategies, and analyzed performance metrics as a grade team leader, teacher manager, instructional coach, critical student intervention coordinator, individualized learning specialist, principal-in-residence and dean of instruction.
