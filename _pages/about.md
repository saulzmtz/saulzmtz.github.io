I love data â€” exploring it, wrangling it, and uncovering the stories hidden inside. I recently earned my M.S. in Advanced Data Analytics, where I gained hands-on experience in statistical analysis with Python and Excel, building interactive dashboards in Tableau and Plotly, and creating machine learning models in Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab.

I majored in Philosophy and have taught English Language Arts to students from 5th to 10th grade. I have also led data-driven initiatives, designed intervention strategies, and analyzed performance metrics as a grade team leader, teacher manager, instructional coach, critical student intervention coordinator, individualized learning specialist, principal-in-residence and dean of instruction. My extensive background (20+ years) in K-12 education (M.Ed. in Curriculum and Instruction) helps me bring a unique perspective to data exploration and analysis.
