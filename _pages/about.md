I enjoy exploring, wrangling, and analyzing data to derive meaningful insights and solutions (M.S. in Advanced Data Analytics). My coursework and project experience includes statistical analysis using Excel and Python, interactive data visualizations with Plotly and Tableau, and building machine learning models in Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab environments.

My extensive background (20+ years) in K-12 education (M.Ed. in Curriculum and Instruction), I bring a unique perspective to data analysis having led data-driven initiatives as a grade team leader, designed intervention strategies as a critical student intervention coordinator and individualized learning specialist, and analyzed performance metrics as a principal-in-residence and dean of instruction.
