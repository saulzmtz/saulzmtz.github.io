I love data â€” exploring it, wrangling it, and uncovering the stories hidden inside. I recently earned my M.S. in Advanced Data Analytics, where I gained hands-on experience in statistical analysis with Python and Excel, building interactive data visualizations in Tableau and Plotly, and creating and evaluating machine learning models (linear and logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) in Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab.

I majored in Philosophy and have taught English Language Arts to students from 5th to 10th grade. I have also led data-driven initiatives, designed intervention strategies, and analyzed performance metrics as a grade team leader, teacher manager, instructional coach, Critical Student Intervention Coordinator, ELL Coordinator, Individualized Learning Specialist, Principal-in-Residence and Dean of Instruction. My extensive background (20+ years) in K-12 education (M.Ed. in Curriculum and Instruction) helps me bring a unique perspective to data exploration and analysis.
