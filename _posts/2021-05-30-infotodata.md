After taking my first two Information Science courses, Information Organization and Information and Knowledge Professions, I decided to take two data analysis and visualization related courses. These two courses in the Info Science program--[Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mirror.facultyinfo.unt.edu/joh0019%2Fschteach%2FINFO5810-001005%20Syllabus-1.pdf) and [Data Visualization and Communication](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mirror.facultyinfo.unt.edu/jy0282%2Fschteach%2FINFO5709_Fall2020-1.pdf) led me to end my brief journey in the Information Science graduate program to pursue the Master of Science program in Advanced Data Analytics. A new journey begins!
